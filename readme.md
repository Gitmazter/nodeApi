This is a nodeJS blockchain that i built as a school assignment.

To use it, run the server in /honkchain locally
Then start the web interface in /honkIo

If nothing has broken since I submitted the project you should be able to:

<li>Create an account or Load your own wallet from private key</li>
<li>Search the block explorer</li>
<li>Airdrop honk tokens</li>
<li>Send and receive honk tokens</li>
<li>Mint an NFT</li>
<li>Burn Tokens</li>
<li>Burn NFT</li>

Chain persists between server restarts and validates itself when loading
