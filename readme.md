This is a nodeJS blockchain that i built as a school assignment.

To use it, run the server in /honkchain locally
Then start the web interface in /honkIo

If nothing has broken since I submitted the project you should be able to:

Create an account or Load your own wallet from private key

Airdrop honk tokens
Send and receive honk tokens
Mint an NFT
Burn Tokens 
Burn NFT
